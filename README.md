## MapReduce
-------
* Usage : 
  1. after unzipping, run make within the proj3 folder.
    - running make will remove the old output.txt file
  2. Running: 
    - "./project <inputfile> <n> <b>"
    - the input files are named "input1.txt", 2, or 3
    - the file number go up based off file size.
    - an output.txt file will be created for you to reference the unique word counts.
